# Clippy
A Simple Clipboard Chrome Extension

#### What is Clippy?
Clippy is a simple clipboard chrome extension that allows you to save texts for future use by copying and pasting, just like a regular clipboard

#### Why did I build Clippy?
 As someone who switched to Macbooks nearly a year ago, I've had an issue with the fact that i cannot have access to my clipboard history. Like when i copy something and copy another thing, I cannot access what I previously copied. THere are other tools that solve this problem, but I just felt like solving it in my own unique way

#### How long will it take me to build Clippy? 
I'm currently working on a timeline of May 22 - May 29 (edit: This is taking longer than expected). I have a few other things i'm working on, but I should be done before or on this deadline.... hopefully
